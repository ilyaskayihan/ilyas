## Homework Task II -- Structured Programming in R

This is your second homework task, and the first task that will be graded. Therefore, the task description further down will also explain how the grading works in more detail than in future tasks. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any problems, especially considering the setup and getting things to run.

## Information Material

### [Slides](ProgR_02_Structured_Programming_I.pdf)

Read these first.

You should probably click through the slides at least twice: Once to get familiar with the topic and see what we want. Then you should read (some of the) other material we link to here. After you read and studied that material, possibly even after you started doing the exercises, you should probably read the slides again, because there are some subleties that you may have missed the first time.

We cover some topics in some detail in the slides that we feel is not as well explained or illustrated in the linked material below. If we leave something out from the slides, it is not because we think it is not important, but because we think it is explained better elsewhere. Please try to be familiar with the material listed in the "What We Expect You to Know" slides and the material needed to solve the homework task, independent of how well it is covered in the slides.

### [What We Expect You to Know](ProgR_Condensed_02_Structured_Programming_I.pdf)

Things you should learn in this unit, from the slides but also (important!) from the material below. This particular unit lists a lot of functions that you should look at. However, many of them are very predictable given their name and their arguments and they often follow a pattern, so it is not as much to learn as it may seem at first. On the other hand, knowing about these functions will make your life much easier in the future, so there is a large payoff.

### Other Material

The items listed with **S** are "Short" and even if you skip the others, you should at least look at these ressources to see if you can take anything home from it. They are high quality ressources and the potential gains outweigh the very minor time cost of looking.

* **S** **[The recap document](assets/recap.pdf)** (which is the same as the one lined from this course's moodle page) of last year's course is the condensed form of the course slides.
* **The Art of R Programming** (you can find copies of it online...) is the book used for the first part of last year's course and you can review it for this task. The relevant chapters are chapters 1-6. This book proceeds slowly and goes into many details, so it can help you if you want thorough explanations and don't mind reading a lot.
* **[Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)** is another book you can review for this task. Especially **chapters 5, 9, and 11** should be useful for you.
* **S** **[R Language Definition](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.pdf)**: While books emphasise comprehensibility, the Language Definition is a very short reference for the R language. It is not the best source to *learn* the material from, but it is a succinct reference and may clear up confusion you have about some aspects of R. We would suggest that you look into the Language Definition from time to time and read through sections on newly learnerd topics. Consider reading **Pages 2--19** which are useful for this task.
* **S** **[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)** is an advanced treatment of extended features of R with quite a few topics that go beyond the scope of this course. Relevant chapters for this homework are **"Data Structures", "Subsetting", and "Vocabulary"**. Advanced R is not as short as the other **S** resources, but the information density is still very high so it is recommended you check it out.
* **The R help pages** accessed by `?` or `help()` are a very useful tool to learn about included functions. A list of useful functions to learn about is given in the slides.
