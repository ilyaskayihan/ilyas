You can use this document to check your R submission. (Although this is just a wrapper around the `evaluate_submission.R` file, which you can also call using `Rscript evaluate_submission.R` from the terminal).

To skip code style checks, set the `SKIP_STYLE` variable to `TRUE`. To restrict checks to single exercises, set `EXERCISES`-vector to something, e.g. `EXERCISES = c("2", "3.1")`. Note that restricting to idividual excersises results in a more detailed error description. Reset `SKIP_STYLE` to `FALSE` and `EXERCISES` to `character(0)` to run the complete tests.

```{r}

SKIP_STYLE <- FALSE
EXERCISES <- character(0)

source("evaluate_submission.R")
```
